# AWS-CMS
CMS on AWS

This deployment is for a WordPress server, running on an Autoscaling group, behind an aplication load balancer, which is behind a network load balancer.

WordPress is open-source software, which means anyone can study its code and write apps (plugins) and templates (themes) for it.

I use bitnami Wordpress server, which comes with the new Gutenberg editor and over 45,000 themes and plugins. The image is certified by Bitnami as secure, up-to-date, and packaged using industry best practices, and approved by Automattic, the experts behind WordPress.
